## 📌 Future Ideas for Travel App

### 1. Integrate a travel budget tracker with emoji-based expense categories
* **Description**: Add a feature that allows users to track their travel expenses using visual emoji tags (e.g., 🍕 for food, 🚕 for transport).
* **Benefit**: Makes budgeting fun and intuitive.

### 2. Add a shareable trip link with custom preview
* **Description**: Enable users to generate a custom link for each trip, including preview images, title, and description.
* **Benefit**: Makes it easier to share plans with friends or on social media.

### 3. Create a color-coded priority system for trip activities
* **Description**: Let users assign priority levels to activities using color codes (e.g., red = high, yellow = medium, green = low).
* **Benefit**: Improves visual organization and planning efficiency.

### 4. Implement a 'Trip Inspiration' mood board with dynamic travel suggestions
* **Description**: Add a visual board where users can pin dream destinations, and the system suggests relevant trips.
* **Benefit**: Encourages discovery and engagement.

### 5. Add playful loading animations for trip creation

Perfect—that simplifies and focuses things a lot. If the app is mainly for your **family**, here’s how I’d tailor the recommendation:

# 🔧 **Tailored Plan for a Family-Oriented Travel App
#### ✅ Phase 1 – Shared Family Account with Invite System
**Goal:** Let one family member (e.g. you) manage the app and invite others (partner, kids, etc.) to contribute.
* **One "Family Account" or Group**: Think of it like a shared workspace.
* **Invites via Email or Link**: Send a family member a link to join.
* **Shared Everything**: All family members see the same trips, accommodations, activities, etc.
* **Equal Access for All**: No need to worry about restricting access (at least for now).

> It’s basically one shared travel dashboard for your household.

### 💡 Simple Example User Flow

1. You sign up and become the account owner.
2. You go to "Invite Family" → add your partner’s email.
3. They receive a link, sign up, and get access to all shared trip planning data.
4. Everyone can edit, add, or remove things (trips, bookings, tasks, etc.).

---

### 🧱 Suggested Data Model (Simplified)

```ts
FamilyGroup {
  id
  name // e.g., "The Smiths"
  createdByUserId
}

User {
  id
  email
  name
  // ...
}

FamilyGroupMembership {
  id
  groupId
  userId
}
```

No need for complex roles unless you want them later.

### 🧩 Phase 2 (Optional Later)

If the kids are younger, you might later want:

* **"View Only" Access** (so they don’t delete trips).
* **Per-feature toggles** (e.g. allow adding notes, but not changing bookings).

But that’s not essential now—your current plan is solid and **lean**.

Would you like me to:

* Draft a schema and migration for the `FamilyGroup` setup?
* Outline the invite-by-email logic?
* Show how to associate users to the same group on login?

Pick the next step you want to move on.

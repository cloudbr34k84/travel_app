**Prompt 1 – Add Accommodation Button Integration Review**
Act as a full-stack reviewer. On the Accommodation page, inspect the “Add Accommodation” button and answer:
- Is its click handler calling the real accommodation-creation API (not mock)?
- Are request payloads correctly built (e.g. JSON keys match backend)?
- Does it disable itself or show loading while the network request is in flight?
- Does it show a success toast on 2xx and an error toast on non-2xx?
- Are network errors (e.g. timeout, 500) caught and surfaced as toasts?

- Accommodation Button Integration Review
After analyzing the "Add Accommodation" button implementation in the Accommodations page, here's my review:

- 1. Is its click handler calling the real accommodation-creation API (not mock)?
Yes, the click handler is calling the real API. The application uses TanStack Query's useMutation hook with apiRequestWithJson to make a POST request to /api/accommodations. This is a real API endpoint as seen in the server routes file where it calls storage.createAccommodation(accommodationData).
- 2. Are request payloads correctly built (e.g. JSON keys match backend)?
Yes, the request payloads are correctly built. The form collects data using React Hook Form with Zod validation based on insertAccommodationSchema, which is imported from @shared/schema. This ensures that the frontend validates data using the same schema that the backend expects, maintaining type safety.
- 3. Does it disable itself or show loading while the network request is in flight?
No, the button does not disable itself or show a loading state during the mutation. This is a potential improvement area. The button should be disabled or show a loading indicator while the request is in progress to prevent multiple submissions.
- 4. Does it show a success toast on 2xx and an error toast on non-2xx?
Yes, it properly handles toast notifications:
On success: Shows a toast with title "Success" and description "Accommodation created successfully"
On error: Shows a toast with title "Error", description "Failed to create accommodation", and variant "destructive"
- 5. Are network errors (e.g. timeout, 500) caught and surfaced as toasts?
Yes, the error handling in the mutation's onError callback will catch all errors, including network errors, and surface them as error toasts. The apiRequestWithJson function used within the mutation handles the fetch request and would throw errors for any failed requests, which would then be caught by the onError handler.
****Areas for Improvement:
- Loading State: Add a loading state to the button while the request is in flight to prevent multiple submissions
- Specific Error Messages: The error toast could show more specific error information rather than the generic "Failed to create accommodation" message
- Form Validation Feedback: While the form has validation through Zod, real-time validation feedback could enhance user experience
- Overall, the implementation is solid and follows best practices for API integration, but could benefit from these minor UX improvements.

**Prompt 2 – Add Accommodation Modal Fields & Validation**
Review the Add Accommodation modal and verify:
- It contains the following fields with correct types:
  - Accommodation Name (required text)
  - Type (required enum dropdown)
  - Destination (dropdown populated via live API)
- All required fields enforce client-side validation before submit.
- Validation errors display inline beneath the field.
- The “Submit” button is disabled until the form is valid.
- On submit, invalid server responses (e.g. 400 with field errors) map back to the correct field errors/toasts.

**Prompt 3 – Destination Dropdown Population & Fallback**
Examine the “Destination” dropdown both in the modal and on the main filter bar:
- Does it fetch the live list of destinations via API each time?
- Are the options driven by the same endpoint in both places?
- If the dropdown list is empty, is there placeholder text like “No destinations—add one”?
- Does clicking that placeholder open the Add Destination modal?
- Is there a loading state (spinner/“Loading…”) while fetching?
---
**Prompt 5 – Search Box & Table Data**
Audit the search and table integration:
- Does typing in the search box debounce user input and call the search API endpoint?
- Are search results rendered from the API response (not mock fixtures)?
- Is empty-state handling in place (“No accommodations found”)?
- Are pagination or infinite-scroll states correctly linked to API cursors/params?
- Are error toasts shown if the search request fails?
